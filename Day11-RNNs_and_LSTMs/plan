Working from the solutions notebook:

For each model:
Make sure i understand how you 
	Build them,
	Train them,
	Use them to make predictions 

For each function:
	Figure out what is going on graphically
	Figure out the function:
		input
		output
	Figure out how to run the function and make sense of the input/output
